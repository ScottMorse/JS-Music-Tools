# JSMusician

This is a script which is intended to be a translation of PyMusician into Javascript.  This project is still in the works and is not intended for public use yet, though one can read the file and use some of the classes defined here, such as Note, Interval, and Mode, which mirror the same functionality as the same classes from <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ScottMorse/PyMusician">PyMusician</a>.
